I'm currently not seeing any results, so I need to clarify what the expectations for the UI are. It seems like I may only need minimal details to get started, but since the prompt asked for specifics, I should probably dig a bit deeper. Perhaps I can explore tests or seed data to find relevant section examples that could guide me. It's worth taking the time to ensure I'm gathering the right information!

I’m thinking we won’t use OCR and will manually inspect the pages. I need to choose where to start for movements. It seems logical to include the cover and a blank page, with Movement I starting at page 003. For Movement II, maybe starting around page 34 makes sense since Movement I is longer. I’ll sample pages 033 and 034 to see if they work, planning to use view_image for those specific pages.

I’m considering how to divide music segments appropriately without cutting corners. It seems focused on metronome marks and the fastest notes per section. I could create a few sections for each movement to capture main tempos and other markings, but I must avoid making things up. I can highlight uncertainties as comments for review. I’ll use IMSLP for movement lists, check for tempo and key, and spot time signatures from the score pages. I need to inspect the first pages.

I'm pondering whether it's acceptable to note uncertainties in my comments while still proceeding with the output. I need to inspect the headings for movements and find the page numbers where each begins to determine the tempo indications. There are 130 pages, and I could script to generate low-res contacts or run an algorithm to detect tempo marking text. Unfortunately, without OCR tools installed, manual sampling might be the best approach. It’s tricky since I need the fastest notes per measure without scanning.

I’m noticing some trouble with movement headers, likely on pages 003 and 052 for movements 1 and 2. Movements 3 and 4 probably are around pages 083 and 103. The headers may not show properly because they could be on the left-hand page with titles in the margin. I might find where "Marcia Funebre" is printed by looking for that unique horizontal title at the top. Page 052 has "Marcia Funebre" and indicates a 2/2 time signature, but I need to double-check the cropping for clarity.
